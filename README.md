# Texture analysis

This script was developed for the needs of the Computer Vision module for Robotics and Autonomous
systems at Lincoln University. 
The object of this project was to introduce the consept of Feature Calculation/Extraction from pictures.
The focus of this specific project was to use Spectral and Statistical texture analysis methods in order
to extract texture information from a picture. Moreover, using Textural features presented in [Textural Features for Image Classification
](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4309314), features about contrast, energy, dissimilarity and more were calculated.
These scripts were used to do an extensive analysis on ways to extract texture information and the 
effectiveness of the aforementioned methods.
